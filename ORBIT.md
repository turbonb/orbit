# ORBIT Studio Narrative

## Brand Essence
Orbit is the studio’s signature launch sprint: a boutique model that fuses high-velocity execution with design-first craftsmanship. The studio exists for founders, small teams, and creative leads who need premium web experiences without the bloated timelines typical of agencies. Orbit keeps its promise by pairing a seasoned principal builder with a flexible collaborator bench, delivering Supabase-backed digital products that feel cinematic, performant, and reliable.

## What Orbit Stands For
- **Velocity Without Drag** — Orbit is intentionally faster than traditional lead-dev firms or piecemeal contractor teams. Engagements are designed to skip the bureaucracy and decision thrash that slows output elsewhere, while maintaining enterprise-grade quality.
- **Relentless Curiosity** — Continuous learning is baked into the operating system. Every sprint pulls in emerging Supabase patterns, motion studies, automation tools, and product heuristics so clients benefit from a studio that is always leveling up.
- **Obsessive Alignment** — Clients describe the outcome, Orbit shoulders the execution. Discovery rituals translate stakeholder intent into structured build plans, keeping delivery tightly bound to the needs articulated by the customer.
- **Accessible Excellence** — Pricing is calibrated for ambitious startups and lean teams. Offering mid–four-figure entry points and transparent milestones ensures Orbit remains an approachable partner without diluting craft.

## Positioning & Value Pillars
- **Speed with Precision** — Sprint timelines (10–21 days) without compromising polish. We pair tight feedback loops with automation to keep reviews and implementation in lockstep.
- **Design-Forward Engineering** — Every project blends modern motion, responsive typography, and expressive palettes. UI/UX choices are grounded in strategy—conversion targets, content hierarchy, and brand story.
- **Automation-Ready Foundations** — Supabase (Auth/DB/Storage/RLS) combined with Next.js, Tailwind, and Framer Motion provides an extensible base. Integrations frequently include Playwright smoke suites, VoltAgent automations, and Redis/BullMQ job orchestration.
- **Collaborative Ownership** — Clients receive a single accountable product lead (Nick Brooks) plus optional specialists. Shared Notion/Linear boards, Loom walk-throughs, and live design reviews keep stakeholders aligned.

## Target Clients
Orbit serves early-stage founders, marketing teams launching new offerings, and product leads modernizing revenue-critical surfaces. Ideal partners:
- Need a marketing or product experience launched inside a month.
- Value strategic storytelling alongside conversion funnels.
- Prefer TypeScript-centric stacks, Supabase, or automation-led workflows.
- Demand a transparent process with room for async collaboration.

## Process Playbook
Orbit’s workflow is engineered to feel orchestrated rather than rushed. Each phase carries clear decisions, visible output, and momentum that never drifts.

1. **Discovery & Alignment (Days 1–2)** — A focused kickoff uncovers business context, user stories, and non-negotiables. We audit existing assets, analytics, and integrations, then translate that signal into a living roadmap housed in Linear or Notion. Clients leave this stage with success metrics, decision cadence, and shared language.
2. **Design Sprint (Days 3–6)** — High-fidelity explorations emerge quickly: Figma layouts, motion concepts, and copy notes that capture tone. Daily Loom recaps allow stakeholders to respond async, while live reviews handle big swings. Feedback is gathered decisively so engineering can begin in parallel.
3. **Build & Polish (Days 7–12)** — Implementation runs on a shadcn/Next.js + Supabase stack. We stand up data models, RLS policies, and automation hooks while components are hardened for accessibility and performance. Playwright smoke suites and Lighthouse passes keep quality measurable.
4. **Launch & Amplify (Days 13–14)** — Final QA, content freeze, and deployment to Vercel/Supabase. We wire analytics dashboards, rehearse handoffs, and assemble launch collateral (announce email, social snippets, press notes) so teams can activate immediately.
5. **Post-Launch Support (Optional, +14 Days)** — For partners who opt in, we stay on to watch metrics, execute rapid-fire tweaks, and fine-tune automations based on live feedback. Reduced drag, quick wins, and thoughtful iteration keep the momentum intact.

## Founder Profile
Orbit is helmed by **Nick Brooks**, a builder who pairs deep engineering rigor with a director’s eye for narrative. After leading full-stack deliveries across startups and emerging brands, Nick launched Orbit to prove that speed and sophistication can coexist.

- **Technical Mastery** — Next.js 15, React 18/19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Supabase (Auth/DB/Storage/RLS), Framer Motion, Redis/BullMQ, VoltAgent, Playwright, Docker-based environments.
- **Product Fluency** — Translates fuzzy briefs into structured launch plans, choosing automation and Supabase patterns that reduce manual overhead.
- **Collaboration Style** — Operates as a single accountable owner while curating a trusted specialist bench (design, illustration, devops) when projects demand it. Clients stay in the loop via Loom recaps, async feedback threads, and decisive live reviews.
- **Learner’s Mindset** — Weekly R&D blocks keep the studio ahead of Supabase releases, shadcn patterns, and motion trends. Insights roll into a private knowledge base that informs each sprint.

## Working With Orbit
- **Intake** — Stakeholders articulate goals, must-haves, and guardrails; Orbit reframes them into a playbook with deliverables, milestones, and budget clarity.
- **Communication** — Linear or Notion dashboards provide transparency; Slack or shared channels handle day-to-day questions. Loom summaries ensure no feedback is missed.
- **Availability** — Monday–Thursday for workshops and collaboration, Friday reserved for delivery polish and documentation. Emergencies are acknowledged within the same business day.
- **Co-Creation** — Clients are invited into crit sessions and review loops without being burdened by implementation details. Orbit owns the build so teams can stay focused on strategy, content, and launch readiness.
