# Orbit Webflow Port — Progress

## 2025-10-23
- Global palette and typography rebuilt to align with Webflow reference while keeping Orbit copy points (`frontend/src/app/globals.css`).
- Navigation refactored with light theme, responsive menu, and Orbit branding assets (`frontend/src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`).
- Hero section redesigned around new layout, Orbit narrative, and sprint stats (`frontend/src/components/sections/hero.tsx`).
- About and services rebuilt using Webflow two-column + accordion patterns, mapped to Orbit offerings (`frontend/src/components/sections/about.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/sections/services.tsx`).
- Showcase + social proof phase added: projects, metrics, press logos, gallery, and testimonials aligned to the Webflow layout (`frontend/src/components/sections/projects.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/sections/stats.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/sections/press-gallery.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/sections/gallery.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/sections/testimonials.tsx`).
- Contact form CTA and footer rebuilt with Webflow-inspired forms, success messaging, and newsletter capture (`frontend/src/components/sections/cta.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/layout/site-footer.tsx`).

# Silver Lining — Workstream B Progress

## Page Implementation
- Home (`/`): hero, partner strip, highlights, performance snapshot, safety banner, team spotlight, metrics grid, blog preview, CTA form wired with client-side acknowledgement.
- Services (`/services`): hero overview, sticky process showcase, service pillars grid, package comparison, metrics, CTA.
- About (`/about`): hero story, journey timeline, impact banner, values grid, leadership spotlight with metrics, CTA.

## Dependencies & Asset Needs
- Final photography/video assets for hero, sticky mosaic, and leadership cards. Current layout uses neutral gradients as placeholders.
- Monochrome partner/accreditation logos (Thumbtack Elite, Google Reviews, Angi Pros, Local Chamber, Eco-Clean Certified) sized for the partner strip.
- Blog post data source (Supabase collection or MDX) to replace static preview content.
- PDF or landing resource for "Download detailed checklist" links, or update targets once collateral is ready.
- Confirm contact endpoint / server action for the walkthrough form; currently the CTA form only shows a client-side confirmation state.

## Follow-ups
- Align with design/brand lead on final color tokens and any additional accents (seasonal campaigns).
- Coordinate with Supabase workstream for inquiry submission handling before launch.

# Silver Lining — Workstream C Progress

## Page Implementation
- `/contact`: hero split with service footprint, client-side quote form, and five-item accordion FAQ with motion.
- `/blog`: centred hero, dark featured grid (3 posts), and all-articles grid sourced from placeholder dataset.
- `/blog/[slug]`: category badge hero, responsive hero media, rich text renderer with CTA buttons, and related articles module.

## Placeholder Data & Assumptions
- Blog dataset lives in `src/data/silver-lining-blog.ts` with author metadata, rich text blocks, and related post mapping.
- Hero art uses gradient SVG placeholders in `public/images/blog/` until photography is delivered.
- Author avatars default to initials; replace with final headshots when available.
- Contact form simulates submission with a 1.2s delay and honeypot field—swap to Supabase action/API when ready.

## Pending Assets / Next Steps
- Confirm production contact number and hours reflected in hero + error copy.
- Provide category filter requirements to wire querystring filtering (buttons currently link to placeholder query params).
- Align on blog pagination expectations once Supabase feed is integrated (current grid renders all posts).
